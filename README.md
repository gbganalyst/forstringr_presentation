The string (or character) data type typically requires more manipulation
to be helpful for data analysts. Thus, there is a need for a robust
package that is up to the task. **forstringr** is a new package built on
top of stringr to execute various string manipulations in R programming.
The main aim of forstringr is to simplify string manipulation for R
beginners. This package combines its power with the adaptability of
other manipulation tools such as tidyr and dplyr. Like in the stringr
package, most functions in `forstringr` begin with `str_`.
